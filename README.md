========

The Ancestry-Aware Forward-in-Time Simulator


================ DOWNLOAD ====================

For downloading the latest stable version of AnA-FiTS, please visit the link  

https://github.com/aberer/AnA-FiTS/tags

You may always directly download the latest (non-tagged)
github-version, but in the worst case you get an intermediate
development version this way.


================ INSTALLATION ================

Installation is straight-forward, except for two dependencies: 

* BOOST
Please install the latest version of boost. On debian/ubuntu systems,

this is as easy as entering

 > sudo apt-get install  libboost-all-dev

dependencies: 
* libboost-all-dev

development:
* libgoogle-perftools-dev
* xutils-dev (makedepend)
* exuberant-ctags
* maybe libjudy-dev


For anything else, please consult the manual.
